This simulator is a simulation program that allows several trains to depart from a designated starting point and arrive at their destination without colliding with each other. This simulator provides the following features.
Supported Features

* Key features:

    A facility to build the system by adding track segments, connections between track segments, signals, and a train.
    A facility to start the system and run the simulation.
    The simulation sets signals automatically to avoid collisions.
    The simulation ends when all trains have stopped

* Optional features:

    A facility to display the complete system once built. The format of this display could be as simple as a list of segments and signals, or as elaborate as a graphical display.
    A facility to save the layout of the system to file, and to retrieve a layout from file.
    It support for multiple trains running concurrently.
    Implement support for trains longer than one track segment.
